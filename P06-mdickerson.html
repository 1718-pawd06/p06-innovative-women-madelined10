         <img class="img1" src= eblackwell1.jpg alt="Elizabeth Blackwell">
         <p>"Elizabeth Blackwell was the first woman to graduate from medical school in the United States. She graduated top of her class at <a href="https://nyheritage.org/collections/geneva-medical-college-1834-1871">Geneva Medical College</a>. She also became a leading public health activist during her lifetime. Blackwell was inspired to pursue medicine by a dying friend who said her ordeal would have been better had she had a female physician. Most male physicians trained as apprentices to experienced doctors; there were few medical colleges and none that accepted women, though a few women. In the mid-1850s, she opened a clinic that became known as the <a href="https://lifeandlegacyofelizabethblackwell.weebly.com/new-york-dispensary-for-poor-women-and-children.html">New York Dispensary for Poor Women and Children</a>. With help from her sister and fellow doctor <a href="https://cfmedicine.nlm.nih.gov/physicians/biography_36.html/">Emily Blackwell</a>, who worked as a surgeon. Elizabeth Blackwell also established the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children in 1857, an institution that would last for more than a century. She also created a medical school for women in the late 1860s. Blackwell returned to Europe and worked in London and Paris. She focused on midwifery at La Maternité, where she contracted a disease during a procedure on an infant that left her blind in one eye; she was thus unable to practice surgery as she had wished. Blackwell later returned to New York City <img class="img3" src= eblackwell3.jpg alt="Elizabeth Blackwell Painting">and established a private practice, at first struggling financially again due to the prejudices of the day. Dr. Blackwell traveled widely across Europe and became increasingly interested in social reform movements dedicated to women’s rights, family planning, hygiene, eugenics, medical education, sexual purity and Christian socialism."</p>
